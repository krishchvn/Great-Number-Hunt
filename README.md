# Great Number Hunt - Legion Security Riddle 

(https://legion-riddle.onrender.com/)

Your Mission (Should You Choose to Accept It)
Somewhere on this website, 500 pages are hiding in plain sight. Each one is guarding a secret number like a digital dragon hoarding treasure. Your job? Find them all!

First things first: You'll need to sweet-talk our API into revealing where these pages are hiding. Don't worry, we're using OpenAPI in the standard way, so it's basically an open book. (Get it? OpenAPI? We'll see ourselves out...)

Plot twist! The API is a bit of a prankster and will give you paths to 500 real pages mixed with some imposters. Like a digital game of "Two Truths and a Lie," but with way more lies.

For each real page, you'll need to fire up a headless browser (Puppeteer or Playwright - your choice, we're not picky). Then: click ALL 5 buttons at the top (yes, all of them!), the number will hide until you clicked them! Open the rows in the "Important Information Table" section, and find the hidden number inside. Fair warning: the number likes to play games and may jump from the left column to the right column on different pages. Keep your eyes peeled!

Once you've collected all 500 numbers, add them all together, and send us the total sum. Good luck!

Pro tip: The /openapi endpoint is your new best friend. Start there, and may the odds be ever in your favor! ðŸŽ¯

Solved using Python, Javascript and Playwright

Read URLs from a urls.json file to loop through each page.

Clicked main buttons and row buttons on each page to reveal content.

Checked for specific span elements (number-placeholder-left or number-placeholder-right) and extracted the text.

Stored the extracted texts in an array and threw an error if expected elements were missing.

The answer is 256473.
